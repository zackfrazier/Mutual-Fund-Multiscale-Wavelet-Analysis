# Mutual-Fund-Multiscale-Wavelet-Analysis

This is a Jupyter file that uses PyWavelet to analyze mutual funds with varying investment horizons by finding the sharpe ratio at different scales of the wavelet. 
The data that must be plugged in is mutual fund investment style and returns over a period of time and the corresponding U.S. Treasury bond yields.
